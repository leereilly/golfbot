Someone at GitHub HQ was [~~trolling~~ praising my hashtag prowess](https://twitter.com/github/status/1142185951294193664), so I decided to share the script that powers numerous multimillion dollar, worldwide social media campaigns.

Simply `./nicehashtagging.sh` to be dazzled and delighted:sparkles: by AI-powered hashtag suggestions for your next campaign.

This was a weekend hack to build something completely useless with [Golfbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot), one of the [Noops Challenge bots](https://noopschallenge.com/).

Works on ~~all devices and operating systems~~ my MacBook. ~~Enjoy!!!~~
